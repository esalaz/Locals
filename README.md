# Locals
Our app is meant for the person who's planning a visit to a new city, but wants an authentic experience of the city, now go to crowded tourist trap after crowded tourist trap. Maybe this person is short on time and can't research their destination city too much (and if we're being honest, some of the best local hangouts aren't easily searchable online). Or maybe this person wants to explore a new city with the help of someone more familiar with the area. This is the traveler.

But our app isn't complete without a local to show you around. The local is an extravert who wants to be active and be outside while also meeting new and interesting people. Maybe their friends are away for the weekend and they want to go on their favorite hike, BBQ house, or bar.

In comes Locals.

Sign up as a traveler and find locals in the city you'll be in next. View their profile, message them to ensure they'll give you the experience you're looking for, and finally book them though our PayPal link.

Or, sign up as a local and wait for a traveler to message you, and enjoy hanging out with new people.
